# Outstanding to-do items. Can be tentatively assigned as noted below.

NICK
----
* Rearrange all HTML5Adapter-affected code so it uses recordQueue in synchronous as well, to prepare.
* Add queryQueue to options in query
* Make id optional in model declaration again
* Move util.js. save.js out of model dir. Need to update includes and rake task
* HTML5Adapter affects:
  - finders (really just query.js)
  - Record.save()
  - Record.isValid() (for validatesUniquenessOf())
  - Model.create()
  - JazzRecord.migrate() (migrations will simply have to be tooled async themselves, and we'll need to setup the numbered migrations to use a queue similar to query)
  - recordQueue uses push/shift for managing items, contains:
    - original record (setup an empty object and begin pushing values onto it for async?)
    - original callback
    - record
    - depth
    - assoc
    - sql
  so all of these features need to be able to take callbacks
* Test transactions - run assert in callback
* Test async - asserts in callback
* Cascading destroy (must work in async!)

DAVID
-----
* Test performance
* Add updateAttributes() method on Record, allow ID cols or association names both in object literal

JESSE
-----

* add createIndex/dropIndex methods in schema_operations.js (copy names from activerecord, natch)

UNASSIGNED
