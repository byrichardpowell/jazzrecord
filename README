JazzRecord is a simplified ActiveRecord clone for providing a JavaScript ORM layer. It currently supports Gears and Adobe AIR. Like ActiveRecord, Jazz is free and open-source software. And in being inspired by ActiveRecord, Jazz seeks to minimize its learning curve by mimicking ActiveRecord style and conventions.
