* association-saving/loading on save, association-unlinking on destroy
  * Linking/Unlinking associated records on hasMany (unlinking needs a cache of all indexes on init to compare to on save)
  * "" on HABTM (should prove easier)
* Implement proper conditions array handling: ["col1 = ? AND col2 = ?", col1_match, col2_match]
* Implement group as option in Model.select()
* Implement findBySql
* Implement update, updateAll on Model or Migration
* Implement add'l dirty object methods: http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/3/31/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-dirty-objects
* Massive recode to all vanilla JS
